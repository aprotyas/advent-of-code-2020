# Advent of code 2020

My attempt at completing [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) in C++!
I will try to be descriptive in my solutions (check `src/day<xx>/day<xx>.cpp`)
and include space/time complexity information if possible.

## Completed:
+ Day 01 (12/01/2020)
    + Part 1: 2sum problem
    + Part 2: 3sum problem
+ Day 02 (12/02/2020)
    + Part 1: Password validity count
    + Part 2: Password validity count v2

## How to run
If you're curious and want to run my solutions as is, you'll need CMake
(3.12+) and any popular C++ compiler. In the top-level directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cmake .. && make
cd day<xx> && ./aoc_day<xx>
```
