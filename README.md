# Advent of code 2020

My attempt at completing [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) in C++!
I will try to be descriptive in my solutions (check `src/day<xx>/day<xx>.cpp`)
and include space/time complexity information if possible.

## Completed:
+ Day 01 (12/01/2020)
    + Part 1: 2sum problem
    + Part 2: 3sum problem
+ Day 02 (12/02/2020)
    + Part 1: Password validity count
    + Part 2: Password validity count v2
+ Day 03 (12/03/2020)
    + Part 1: Traversing the world on a toboggan
    + Part 2: Changing slopes on a toboggan
+ Day 04 (12/04/2020)
    + Part 1: Passport has enough fields?
    + Part 2: Passport has valid values?
+ Day 05 (12/05/2020)
    + Part 1: Max seat ID
    + Part 2: What's my seat ID?

## How to run
If you're curious and want to run my solutions as is, you'll need CMake
(3.12+) and any popular C++ compiler. In the top-level directory:

```bash
./configure.sh
./build.sh [day]
./ruh.sh day
```
Where `day` is the day number you would like to build/run.
